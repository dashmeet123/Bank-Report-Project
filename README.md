# Bank-Report-Project

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive bank loan report utilizing the capabilities of MS Excel and Power BI. By leveraging these tools, we will create an interactive and informative dashboard to analyze loan data, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making within the banking sector.

Project Objectives
Data Consolidation: Gather loan data from various sources and consolidate it into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensure data accuracy and consistency by cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct initial analysis to understand data characteristics, identify patterns, and uncover potential insights.
Report Development: Create a detailed and informative loan report using MS Excel, including key performance indicators (KPIs), summary tables, and charts.
Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize loan data, enabling users to explore different perspectives and trends.
Data Sources
